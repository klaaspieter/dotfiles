dotfiles
========

My dotfiles. I don't recommend running these as your own. I'm sharing them so you can steal things for your own dotfiles.

Install
-------

Clone onto your laptop:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/klaaspieter/dotfiles.git
```

Install and configure the following:

- [Homebrew][Install Homebrew] (macOS only)
- [GitHub CLI]
- [1Password CLI]

Install dotfiles using [rcm]:

```sh
rcup
```

Attribution
----------
Many scripts and configurations have been inspired by [thoughtbot]'s [laptop script][thoughtbot laptop repo] and [dotfiles][thoughtbot dotfiles repo]. I've also stolen many things from [Gordon Fontenot][Gordon's dotfiles].
